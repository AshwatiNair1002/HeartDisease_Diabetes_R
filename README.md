This was an individual project done in 2023 for the HI 2021 course in the MSHI program at UPitt. R was used for data visualization, analysis and machine learning. 
The aim of the project was to determine if there is a correlation between fasting blood glucose and heart disease. The Heart Disease Dataset (1988) was the data source. 
A Chi-squared test was conducted to determine an association.
Logistic regression and random forest models were built to test the hypothesis.
